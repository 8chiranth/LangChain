Beneath the sun’s relentless glare,
The field lies waiting, calm and fair.
A bowler’s run, a batter’s stance,
Two hearts engage in timeless dance.

The ball arcs high, a crimson flame,
The crowd erupts, they chant your name.
A crack of willow, sweet and pure,
The boundary’s rope cannot endure.

The fielder dives, a flash of grace,
Each moment etched in time and space.
From gully’s watch to keeper’s call,
The game unites, it charms us all.

For cricket’s more than bat and ball,
It’s courage rising when we fall.
A sport, a dream, a shared delight,
Played in the day, remembered at night.
