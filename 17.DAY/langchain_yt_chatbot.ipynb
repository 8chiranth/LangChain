My motivation was I need to get a rank so decent that I get a choice of my branch and I get a choice of my college. So there are so many branches that you can there are almost like 36 specialties that you can opt for after an EPG is done. So to get a branch of your choice you really have to have a good rank. So you have to study according to that. If you keep this motivation in mind if you feel like there is a certain big reason maybe it's your parents that that you want to see them happy.

So that's what you have to do. You have to surround yourself with people who are studious. So luckily in my MBBS there I had a group of friends though some of them are not my friends anymore but at that time these friends were really motivating and they were studying I was also studying with them and when they were not studying I was motivating them. So that's the idea have a group of friends who are studying together. So if even if one or two of you falls into a study slump you all can pick yourself back.

              "{'context': \"in the morning or in the night. Now my general conclusion, my general ideology for most of the people is that even though that you think that you are a night person, it's not like that. If you try to wake up for a few mornings, maybe just 1 hour before your normal time, you will see that mornings are so productive. Now I'll tell you the reason for this. See, in the morning when you wake up, you're full of energy because you've just woken up from your sleep. You have got all your rest. Your brain is fully active. Now you you have a huge energy store. Now, as the day progresses, there are certain activities that you do that take away your energy. So what our idea is that in our evening our energy stores are low. So whatever things we are studying with a low energy reserve, they're not going to be going in your brain that easily because it's low on energy. It's it's taking more energy um to learn new information to focus. Right? So in the morning when you have a lot of energy, I want you\\n\\nto be going in your brain that easily because it's low on energy. It's it's taking more energy um to learn new information to focus. Right? So in the morning when you have a lot of energy, I want you all to put that energy into studies and do it without any friction. That means just wake up and go to uh sit down on your desk. There's no need to brush your teeth as well. Just go and sit down after one or two hours you can brush your teeth. Okay? As a doctor, I tell you it's okay to not brush your teeth on time. So if you wake up at 4, go brush your teeth. That's all it's going to be okay. So that's the thing. Reduce the friction between your bed to your desk or your to your study space. And that's when you'll see that mornings can be really good too. But if you truly are a night person where you get most of the studies done late night, that's when you know that at this particular time you should have no distractions. You should not be talking to friends. You should not be talking to\\n\\ndecision. You're never going to regret joining a gym. But the thing is stay physically active. That means it can happen that there are it's been 2 3 days and you are still in your room. You have not gone out. You're continuously studying inside your room. You are either on your phone, you're either on your bed or you are either on the desk. You don't get any sunlight in. You don't get any fresh air in your system. You don't have any walk that you are doing. So your muscles and ligaments, tendons, joints, nothing is moving. You know that creates a very bad impact on your health as well as on your life. If you're very very stagnant on a place, your life will also become stagnant. You need to be active both physically, mentally and overall spiritually as well. So whenever you feel like yeah I've been like 2 three days I've been not able to study well I all I have been doing is scrolling my mobile phone just stop everything keep your phone aside just go out for a walk 1 hour you just walk\\n\\nthe hands that prescribe medicines that cure very big diseases or even simply help others. So just look at your hands and visualize what these things are going to be doing in the future and you work hard only for that. When you visualize like this you keep taking into mind your future. These small small exams that you have to give along the way they stop mattering. So you have to keep the bigger picture in mind. If possible make a vision board. I always say this make a vision board. It's really essential that you do that. If possible I'll make a video about how do you make your vision board. And yes, that brings me to my next point is you connect with your peers. So let's say that you are feeling in a study slump. You call up somebody who is studying really well. You ask them a few questions that you are not able to solve. You ask them a few doubts that you are not able to uh solve properly. They will give you a lot of motivation. So if you are not feeling well, connect to your peers\",\n",
